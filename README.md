### Goal

The goal of this challenge was to create an image-sharing web app that allows users to 'like' and 'unlike' their favourite images. All the images are fetched from NASA's Astronomy Photo of the Day (APOD) API, and each image has a name, date of capture, and a small description.

### Extra Features

To improve the user experience, I included additional features such as:
  - Animating the "like" button with a heart
  - A loading indicator while the wait for NASA's API to return data
  - Creating a shareable link for each image
  - Allowing the user to enter a start date for browsing the photos

### Tech Stack

I used **React.js** to build the frontend where I used my own custom UI components as well as ones from the **Material-UI** library.
